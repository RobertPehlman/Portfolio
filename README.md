# Portfolio

Here is a selection of several academic projects that I have completed during my time as a Ph.D. student in statistics at North Carolina State University and during my Masters of Applied Statistics from Pennsylvania State University.

For ST790 (Advanced Computing):

I created an R-package to perform functional Q-learning in a setting without a change point and to incorporate PACE (Principal Analysis through Conditional Expectation) estimates into a functional linear model. Accompanying the R-package is a vignette demonstrating how to use the package.

For ST790 (Longitudinal Data):

My final project involved a nonlinear mixed effects model.

For Statistical Consulting:

I was part of a team that conducted an analysis of student outcomes and created a model to predict student retention by grades. My specific contributions were the entirety of the matrix completion concept, execution and writeup, in addition to the data work for the logistic regression model.


For my masters capstone project:

I investigated the hot-hand phenomena in basketball that is often referenced to explain why shooters make many shots consecutively. I found no evidence for the hot hand effect, confirming an earlier result by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.

As non-class research:

I analyzed data from many administrations of machines which measure breath alcohol content taken during roadside stops for drivers suspected of driving under the influence. Breath alcohol content is frequently used as a proxy for blood alcohol content
